Hello Minecraft world!![/p]
I can’t find a straight answer on Google, I’m trying to find out if there is a way to play with Windows/Xbox players on the Java edition of the game. I had no idea there was a difference between this and the Windows 10 version when I bought the game and really don’t want to have to purchase the game again just to play with an Xbox friend. I saw that those who purchased the Java version before October had the option to switch over to Windows, is this still possible in some way??[/p]

It was until October 2018

For Java players, there is no way to play on Bedrock servers

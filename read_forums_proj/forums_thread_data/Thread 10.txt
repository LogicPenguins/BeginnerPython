Uhh so I heard about Veteran capes coming out and I just wanted to know if when they come out is it only for when you joined on Java because on an xbox account, on my xbox 360 I used to use my dads email but I used to play so if it's allowed to like check when the account started playing minecraft cause it's an xbox account I think the mojang people can see join dates but it was on the account MetalLyric710

I assume you mean the migrator cape, you need to have owned minecraft java prior to them announcing migration of accounts to MS to be able to get one.

ONLY thse who migrate their java account will get it, no console players will as they won't be migrating a java account

I got the orange cape on bedrock and it's ugly. Now I play java tho.

Capes are sacred, I remember notch used to give out capes only for insanely few people. The best cape ever is still the first MineCon cape, the red one. Was it 2013?

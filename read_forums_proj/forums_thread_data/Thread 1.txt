I don't know if what I'm asking for exists but here I go anyway. I'm looking for something like a "dryad" plugin where I'm forced to stay in proximity/stand on wood logs to live. I would need to expand my tree and create "roots" in order to expand where I could travel.

If anyone knows something like this please let me know.

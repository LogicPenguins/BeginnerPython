Thread Title: How will 1.18 interact with worlds created in 1.17.1(question-mark)
Thread Author: JarkB

Post: 

I am wondering if anyone knows whether updating to 1.18 when it eventually releases will update the world height of old worlds? As it stands a world in 1.17 has a world height that ends at y=0, and I understand usually when new world generation is added worlds can be played and new biomes/structures can be found in unexplored chunks. However, will a change that affects the entire world work the same way?

Any insight would be appreciated.

I am 99% sure that the world will automatically increase the depth and height. Along with that it will generate more ores in the extended depths. There is a ore 1.18 chart of where they will spawn if you want to find out more about that. 

Because unexplored chunks only update in most updates. This is different in 1.18 and the whole world will update.

I hope I have helped,

Most likely case, in a 1.17 world converted to 1.18, already generated chunks will be filled below Y=0 with bedrock.

Playing Minecraft in my early elementary years was some of my most fondest memories from the time. Now, if i ever feel like going back and playing Minecraft it never feels the same. Is it because it was bought out by Microsoft or what? Or is it because I can no longer play the game the same way because it was memed in 2016. This could just be me but what ever happened to this game.

My thoughts begun after I watched this video and others -

For me, it was my friends losing interest long before I did. I still come back to the game once in a while, but its not the same as when everyone and their dog was playing minecraft. I still enjoy coming back to it though after getting burnt out from other games, but without all the interest in my local area, minecraft burns me out too after awhile. I'm getting tired of the sad posts about minecraft though, anyone else?

Its several reasons actually and its all okay and normal


Nostalgia. Nostalgia can make the worst things look like it was good. Many people have fond memories playing garbage "korean grinder mmos" for example, or playing some f2p game ran by bots and hackers. Nobody in their right mind would even touch such games nowdays but you as a 10-15 year old kid would be having a blastPerception. As we grow older we start to notice things. And trough out the years trough the internet people started to group up, do some research and point things out (namely flaws). People talking and pointing out so many bugs and flaws in games such as Fallout 76 is one of such cases. A kid trying such game out would have loads of fun with some annoyances if the game shuts down for no reason but still. Change. Minecraft changed over the years. Not just because Microsoft bought it, but the updates and additions to the game it self. When i started to play it during 1.2.2 ,compared to todays 1.13 it was pretty simple. And previous minecraft versions that came before 1.2.2 were even more simpler.Technically speaking, minecraft feels a lot different in gameplay terms than it was before because of all the things added trough the years.
Also, when MC was new, everyones experience was new. Unless you get total amnesia or something you will never experience MC as a brand new game as you had years before when you started it
Different community. Because of all the in game changes, multiplayer also changed from "vanilla survival with friends" or " building competition with everyone in creative" into mega servers with a lot of mini games. Player made maps also changed a lot since they are powered by command blocks.On top of that, most people "lost" friends that they played MC with, and "old veteran" minecraft players kinda already played trough everything over the years so theres nothing new to experience unless MC adds something drastical like a whole new dimension, or a whole new goal.


This happens to all games really, and to all players as well. Its perfectly normal.

What i can suggest to you is to simply think of a new way to play the game (be it minecraft or something else).

Here are some examples

For minecraft, i decided to try out old versions that i didnt play before. I decided to try out buffet worlds, Superflat survival, various challenges, Hardcore survival. Maybe some mods? Add shaders or a new texture pack to change things up.
For long term goals i searched for a "perfect" seed (a huge snow island) ,and make a large 101x100 base on it, and make a portal hub that jumps me to other biomes and parts of the world without worrying about new updates changing world generation.

For a mmo i played for 6+ years now, ive seen lots of old vets complaining about content and how theres nothing new or anything that keeps them playing.
I make new perma death characters, i apply gearing up restrictions (upgrading gear is super easy in the game but i restricted it to a few options that are more challenging than the rest of the game). I added theme builds for my class so i dont blast trough content from lvl 1-max lvl and beyond,

Obviously some games have more freedom while others have more restrictions on your choices, movement, gearing up, progression in general so you cant really "think up" many different ways to play the game. But minecraft exceeds in this.

Most of these reasons I totally agree with. The version of mincecraft I played for the first time ever was beta 1.8 on the Xbox 360 (I was 5 and my brother was 12) So my thoughts on the game was that it was a simple game where I built stuff. I think that's were the game got me. They changed from it's simple coding to some complex flying demon thing that likes to kill me when I don't sleep. I liked it simple..

 Well yeah. 
Back in the day my main set of goals of all survival games was to build a shelter, get some steady food going, mine for better gear, improve and expand shelter. Maybe find a dungeon and make a mob grinder , get to lvl 50 and cross fingers for a good enchant, but still be happy to get a efficiency II and unbreaking 1 on my diamond pickaxe for the cost of 50 levels 

But now i have a ton of goals.
Find the perfect seed, build a large base that can contain all sorts of buildings, automated farms, contraptions, 6 beacons for all 6 effects across 100x100 block radius, a nether portal hub connected with all sorts of biomes that didnt even existed few years ago...

Making a ender farm in the end for exp so i can enchant perfect things, make afk fishing for rare treasure drops, run across lands to explore various temples, loot ship wracks, underwater ruins, pyramids, jungle temples, make a large villager village and trade stuff with them....

Yeah, I'm the same here. I remember buying the game in 2012 when I was just 10 years old. After Notch, sold it to Microsoft; it doesn't feel unique anymore. Every time I go back to the game I'm always left burnt out. The things is online gaming can change throughout the years. An example would be Bungie's original Halo games. Back then, everyone loved it, but after they sold it, some fans believed the next two installments ruined the franchise. Believe it or not, I'm a late Halo player, since 2013. If you keep trying to force the joy of the game, but don't feel it than maybe it's time to move onto a new game? Don't you think?

Me? It's honestly not the same, anymore...

I try finding joy in the game, but couldn't.

I guess I'll move on...

EDIT: I do apologize if my grammar looks werid.

 Minecraft is better than ever; a caves and mountains update is finally coming to help spice the game up a bit, the nether as been made less boring, new items and blocks have been introduced that will help new and old players create unique things; the lightning rod could have plenty of redstone applications, Pillagers and mansions add a unique challenge to the game where old structures lied with next to nothing guarding their loot, etc. Minecraft hasn't gotten worse, you have gotten bored of it. If you actually play the old versions now instead of reminiscing, you'll find equal boredom. Point being, it's naive to point fingers at Notch and Microsoft when really the added budget and developers revived the game in the internet community. Minecraft had a massive resurgence on its 10th anniversary that it wouldn't have had if Minecraft remained basic and unimpressive as it was back then; your 10 year old mind simply perceived Minecraft to be more than there is. In conclusion, Minecraft has not died. Your enjoyment of the game did, and even if you go back to older versions in an attempt to revive any love for the game you won't find any more excitement than you are getting out of modern versions.

Nostalgia. Perception. Change.Different community. 


I'd definitely agree with these factors. Nostalgia can definitely warp your memories, especially if you were at a drastically different point in your like (e.g. in school vs university, or university vs work, etc.). We tend to look back and remember the highlights, but ignore the bad parts.


I remember great times with certain older games and MMOs. If I went back to play them now, I'd probably hate them. The games themselves might not have changed, but I have drastically changed in the intervening years. I'm not the same person that I was back then, so I won't feel the same way when exposed to the same stimuli.

I’m not sure if this is done already, but i believe developers should look at top rated mods and texture packs (staying away from ones that completely change the game, small changes) and learn more about what the community wants more/less of in the game. (new to forums)

People citing mods don't realize that mod users are a very minor percentage of minecraft, even minor if you add up minecraft bedrock edition, which Mojang and Microsoft tend to converge with the parity project.

Are you sure they don't already ??

Lets look back at some of the things Mojang have added & I bet if you look hard enough you probably find that there was a mod that had something like what was added before it was added to vanilla - but Mojang made some sort of change to make it 'unique' for the game and not a direct copy

Horses/Fox/Panda/Dolphins/Bees & basically any new mob that were added after Minecraft was released: Erm... anyone remember 'Mo'Creatures'
Elytra - bet there was some form of Jetpack mod around
Potions - Yep I'm pretty sure there were potions mods before these were introduced
More different foods (Carrots/Potatos/Beetroot etc) - I'm sure there were mods that added new foods, Who can forget the original Rotten flesh to Jerky mod's ?
Nether/End - You can't remember the Aether dimensional mod 
Maps - afaik there's been minimap mods around for years
Colourful blocks (Concrete/Glass/wool etc) - there's always been mods that added new blocks (I'm still waiting for coloured redstone lamps to be vanilla)
Extra Biomes/ Nether update etc - Pretty sure there's been a LOT of mods that created custom biomes that have been around for a while

I'm sure Mojang DOES look at what people want/what mods are being used & then decides if it'll fit in with their game development policies, then decide on how they could be developed further

I believe a LOT of features in the game started as mods. Especially during Notch's time there.

But Mojang also puts a lot of consideration into balance and "feels like minecraft". They won't add dinosaurs or ridable dragons for example.

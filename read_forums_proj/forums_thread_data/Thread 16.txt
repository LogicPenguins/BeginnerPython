Do you think opening a custom written minecraft server (Factions) in 2021 is worth it?

And when yes, would you choose 1.8 OR 1.17/1.16? 

Thanks for every answer/opinion I can read

To answer "is it worth it" we kinda need to know your objectives. What's your metric for "worth"? Why would you start the server; what are you looking to get out of it? Money, friends, etc

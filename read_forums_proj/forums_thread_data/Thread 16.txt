Hi,
Parent of two boys here. We bought Minecraft for PC a while back for my older son and did it through the PC he uses. He plays often and with friends. Now my younger son has been playing - on an iPad through the app or on his PC but logged into my older son's account with a different gamertag. Now, my younger son wants to be able to add friends. Can we do this with the current set up we have or do I have to buy Minecraft again? If I do have to buy it again, that's fine but can I use the same email address I used for the first purchase for the older son or do I need to use a different email address? 

-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.

if you want 2 ingame names you need to buy the game 2 times with separate logins

 Pretty sure your gamertag is tied to your account. I would double-check exactly how and what version of MC does your younger son play on his PC. I wonder if you bought MC back when you could get a free copy of Bedrock (Win10 MC) and your younger redeemed that copy.

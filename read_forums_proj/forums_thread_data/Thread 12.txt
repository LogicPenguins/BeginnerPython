Thread Title: Help with code for removing air pockets from items such as brewing stands
Thread Author: siyonkart

I would like to remove the effect, shown in the image attached below, from items like brewing stands, beds, doors, gates, etc. so that the items act underwater as though they're in water- instead of as in air.
I tried copying from the video below, but it doesn't seem to work for me and the link in the description doesn't work.
Does anyone know of a way to do this in java 1.17?

Beds can already be waterlogged, when they are waterlogged they prevent you from sleeping the night away. The rest would have to be modified through datapack or mod, because Mojang (wisely?) decided to only implement waterlogging for certain blocks.

It's a creative build anyways- just for fun and to show off to friends some ideas
I'd just like to remove the overlay that gives the air pocket effect over certain blocks, but can't seem to find anything pre-made or figure out how to get it to work myself :^)

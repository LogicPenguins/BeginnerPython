Have you tried thinking that you CAN beat them, no matter what kind of mob they are?

Like this:

"Ah there, an Enderman. Time to beat it!"

Not sure if it works, I'm not really afraid of hostile mobs... (except for Spiders, but I kinda got over that. Jumpscares when they attack...)


Yes I have tried that but they always freak the daylights out of me. I started playing cod on my Wii u more than mine craft cause of that fear.

I've never understood this whole "I'm too scared to play Minecraft" thing. I mean, if you're scared of the bad guys in a game like BioShock, that's one thing. Those dudes are scary. But Minecraft? This game is basically a cartoon. What's there to be scared of? You have literally no excuse to be going "Oh my god, run away it's a CREEEPAAAAH!" unless you're some sort of Yogscast fan-boi, or are making a really bad machinima.

I'm more scared of having my things ruined by a creeper, than I am of the creeper itself. I'll admit, the endermen's whatever-you-call-that noise is kind of freaky, but just don't look at them and you'll be cool.

Jump scares are what Minecraft is all about. Just give it a go on easy, you'll get used to it soon enough.

Don't fear them, know your tactics!

Creepers: Sprint at them, that kicks them back out of your range. If there's one close to your home, run away from your house, not towards it! Let it explode in a water body, then it doesn't do any damage to the area.
Spiders: Jump at them, at least that helped me.
Skeletons: Try to get close at them without getting in their line of sight, like hiding behind trees. Then they're easy.
Zombies: If you're confronted with a horde, dig two tiles deep into a wall, go in the hole, then place one block at the entrance. Fight them trhough the window. Rest is easy.
Endermen: Don't look at them. If you look at them, build up three blocks and fight them from up there. Press shift while doing that, to reduce the danger of getting thrown off (from Skellies shooting arrows for example). Also, if you're too afraid to do that make a panic room that is two tiles high. They can't get in there either.

Other tips: Light up caves and shafts in all directions before digging any ores. That reduces the risk of getting blown up from behind. If you're short on torches take them away from branches you already explored and close them off (with cobble). Also light up the landscape around your house! 

Also maybe you can find a ressource pack that makes the mob sounds a little less scary or put the sounds down a little. The endermen freak me out because of their loud cry.

I also tend to talk to mobs like "Come at me bro, you afraid, huh?" or "You stupid little spider, I'll get you with two hits!" Be angry at the mobs, not afraid of them!

I played on peaceful for a really really long time, then on easy and now I'm on normal. It's all about your fighting tactics  Maybe someone else has more tips on that.

I was too scared to go in a cave when I first got the game, they freaked me out. I remember 2 months in, I explored my first cave. Just get some practice, they will go from scary to annoying pretty fast. I used to never go out at night, now I run around at night killing every mob in sight. You've just got to do it.
Their AI is extremely predictable, take advantage of that. Endermen are the only unpredictable mob, stand in a two block high area and they can't touch you. What you need is experience, you'll really see how weak they really are (except blaze, those guys will rip you to shreds.) Now I can circle mobs keeping myself from getting hit, even without it you can easily just keep hitting them so can't can hit you. You can use creative mode to practice shooting mobs like I did,

Like others said: Face your fears. I know when I bought the game for the first time I was super scared of all mobs. It wasn't that they are scary, it's just you know if you die you could lose everything you have worked for. Just go out at night with iron armor and a sword. If you die, so what? It's not hard to get those items back. The only thing that will make you unafraid is practice and experience. Much like public speaking or advanced mathematics.

/gamerule keepInventory true

Means you won't lose your items when you die, so you don't have to fear the mobs so much. The only other thing I can think of is to go out into the night with no items at all (apart from food) and face the mobs head on.



That really helped me (keep inventory)




I was very scared of losing my items from mobs for a while... Now I can play without keep inventory and I'm fine (I still sometimes do so that I can do /kill and be back in my house)

No it isn't the fear of losing my stuff (I use toomanyitems)
It's just that the mobs are so scary

OP, what exactly is it that is scary? You say you have no problem watching others' fight. You also have no problem with the loss that is incurred through death by them in Minecraft.

Is it the appearance, or the sounds? Minecraft mobs can definitely give younger players a scare if they have not experienced any type of "survivial" genre game. I suggest you watch a video of said mobs being friendly or stupid. Maybe that will change your perspective on them.

I recommend Slamacow's Animations for trying to relieve yourself of the fear that Minecraft's mobs are actually scary.

One that I think is just right for you is Wither Skeleton Encounter:

Get a texture pack to make mobs look funny or not so scary.

I have been a long time watcher of this forum. I play MC almost every day and have so for almost a year. I agree MC can be scary, and I still have problems with it. But it is helping me overcome my fear of the dark and high places. Still need to work on getting across the oceans. I find MC very theraputic, and there are days that I have to change the gamemode to peaceful and other days I go in swords blazing. Just recently I went into a cave system on easy, yeah don't laugh for me it was a huge deal. But the point is I am slowly doing it and conquering those fears. I eventually want to work my way up to being able to play a CTM map.

Play on a server with other people. i noticed thats helped a few people. And also its just logical that things are not as scary when done with other people

I had the same fear. What helped for me was just bringing a chest everywhere I went. When the sun went down, I'd just run back to my house, place all my valuables in my chest, take a couple of stone swords and go kill some monsters! That way, if you die you wouldn't lose anything important to you. Also, if you can't find you house by the time night comes, just place the chest down, place the valuables in it and get some resources from mobs, so if you die away from home you still won't lose anything. After you store your valuables, make a beacon near the chest (a stack of dirt with a torch on top) so that you can continue searching for your home and when you find it you can come back and find your stuff when morning comes.

Hope this helped, sorry if it was just spam

Try using a different texture or resource pack, sometimes they can make the Mobs look cute and less scary, like the many candy texture packs that are out there. (Or any movie or cartoon.)

Well when I first started playing minecraft, I was scared of mobs because I would lose my items if I die from them.
- use /gamerule keepinventorytrue
-use peaceful
-use a texture pack
-face them at night
-be brave and just think u can overcome anything!
I have been playing minecraft for over a year now, so I basically overcame my fear.

Realise that their all just NPC's, and your damage on your character does not affect IRL.

Or, just kill 'em. They're really easy to kill anyways.

I have been playing minecraft for a few years now on different platforms like consoles, PE edition and PC Java edition. I remembered when i first started playing, i was afraid of mobs mainly because i'll lose my stuff, it just experience really, if you are afraid of mobs i suggest put strong edm music like drum and bass in the background instead of the game sound itself, it will make you feel like you are rampaging them instead of being afraid of them. Also make sure you have enough tourches and equip a amour and sword before you enter anything that is dark like abandoned mineshafts, caves, dugeons or even go out at night. You can also watch some videos on youtube that makes the mobs not scary at all. Good luck !

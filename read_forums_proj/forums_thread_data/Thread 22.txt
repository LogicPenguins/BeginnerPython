There are 3 protection armor enchantments: projectile protection (protects from projectiles), blast protection (protects from explosions), and Protection. (protects from mostly anything)
 What enchantment would be most useful fighting shulkers?

Hi,
I think projectile protection would work. The reason being is because shulkers fire shulker bullets. These are projectiles which are aiming for you.
I hope I have helped,

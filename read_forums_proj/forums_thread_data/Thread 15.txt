I am near late game and experience isn't really a problem rn for me. so I was trying to look for a afk skeleton farm because I need bone meal for other farms. Is it really worth adding a zombie farm to my skeleton farm?

If you are saying experience isn't a problem for you, then unless you love raw meat then probably not...?

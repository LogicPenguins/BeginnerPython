All depends on what type of videos you enjoy really, just have a look around and see who holds you with their video, everyone's tastes vary and their isn't an exact answer to your question

I struggle between ForgeLabs and Mumbo Jumbo when it comes to entertainment. Watching their videos makes me happy.

Dreams manhunts are thrilling but that's it. I expect some new "how did he surviva that?!" -stunts but nothing else realy.


FitMC makes "historical" content about his favorite server 2b2t. His voice is very dramatic but the content is interesting.

I like Mumbo Jumbo for entertainment value. Gnembon is awesome for 'science' when designing complex stuff. I am also quite fond of Pixelriffs MC survival guide.

Definitely paulsoaresjr. He was the one who started it all. I'm a paetron to him. He's one of the only youtuber who does not treat his channel as a job but as a passion. That's why I like him.

All of these questions are really obvious, to be honest. Even a noob could figure it out by process of elimination.

Just so you know quiz creator, an inverter is not a redstone circuit. The only circuit you had on that quiz was a clock. An inverter is a circuit component. So I guess you are the noob.

So, just because I don't know how many times I logged in right.... (21%)


Right, because if you weren't a noob you would know to check under Statistics.

Quote from Sutinen
and I bought the game when it was beta, makes me a "noob"
Right... 

"A "noob" is a person who is new or inexperienced in a subject, usually an online game."

Thread Title: How to find Command Blocks in the world(question-mark) (1.12)

I've tried using WorldEdit, server logs/console, and even NBTExplorer to try and find a bunch of command blocks likely far far away that are constantly spamming commands on my server. Is there some kind of way/plugin that I can use to locate their coordinates?

The world is in the form of a map that I've downloaded so I've never been near them and there was no player data or anything that I could use to find them.

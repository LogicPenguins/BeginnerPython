Yes, if you bring more villagers into the empty village, they will settle there.

Looks like you triggered a raid. If you kill a pillager captain (one with banner) you get Ill Omen effect. Entering a village with this effect triggers a raid. Next time after you fight pillagers, drink a bucket if milk before going to a village.

You also can't get villagers to just travel from their village. You have to forcefully transport them via boat or minecart. Even once transported, it might have to confine transported villagers so they cant leave their new village until they start using its beds/workstations.

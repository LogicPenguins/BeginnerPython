He's not fake 

But back on topic - first I heard of him was ~2014. 
I stumbled across the '' video by MCJams & started watching the other videos he'd done.


At the start of many of his videos he had a 'Can you find the Hidden Herobrine' & I wondered who/what was Herobrine so started searching for info

Yes, he is. It's a made-up story from a hoax image:[1][2]


But anyway, I actually heard of him some time in 2016 (even though I've been playing the game for years longer).

I think I first heard of him on the forum back in like 2013? I was super into it then, since I was 13 y/o and got obsessed with things easily lol. I think I even had an account called "HerobrineHunter," but I don't remember the login for it. I remember trying to build the "shrine" to him out of gold blocks, redstone torches, and netherrack and being super disappointed when it didn't work. When I finally figured out it was fake, I decided to prank my friend by secretly installing the Herobrine mod onto my game and I would play while she watched. She freaked out seeing the weird stuff he built and how he would just stalk you lol. She was mad for a while when she found out what I did lol. I wonder if that mod is still around? I still love the story tho, and I build him a little shrine in every world I have.

I first had heard about him in around mid-2014, that was when I really started playing minecraft at my friends house on his xbox 360
I can't remember how I heard about it, It just kinda happened

I found out by reading the change logs on updates circa 2011 or so. I was confused by what they meant by "removed Herobrine," and went to look it up on the internet. My thought process was, "Oh, he's a creepypasta. That's pretty fun. What's actually in this update?"  He's cool, though. Fun part of Minecraft history.

It feels like a lifetime ago. I was in high school back in 2010. Pretty much whenever the legend first surfaced is when I heard of it. 

I'm a believer, man!

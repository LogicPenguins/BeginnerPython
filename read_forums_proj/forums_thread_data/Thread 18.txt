Old Minecraft is so much better than modern Minecraft. The game was so much simpler, and fun to play. What is your opinion.

I feel you. 

I enjoy the new stuff. But the game has changed a LOT since I started playing and sometimes I miss the simpler days.

Although I'm not certain if it's simple 2009 minecraft that I miss, or simple 2009 my life that I actually miss. Hahahaha

I mean the ocean update was awesome and so is the nether update. There are still certain things that mojang refuses to add for the sake of purity (like furniture)

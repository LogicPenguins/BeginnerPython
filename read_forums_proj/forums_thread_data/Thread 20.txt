So I recently got a game pc, and I still use my old monitor which has 60 ghz. So would it be good to set my max fps to 60 fps?

Yes, a 60ghz monitor will not be able to display 120 fps so any component work that is in fact generating 120fps will end up with half the frames uselessly being discarded.

For energy consumption reasons, yes; I would recommend keeping an fps limit of 60 if you have a 60 Hz monitor.

 and if the frame rate is out of sync with the monitor it will result in tearing, monitors with gsync or freesync on a compatible graphics card will deal with this problem, but as toydotgame said if the frame rate is allowed to exceed your monitors max it's a waste of electricity.

if using an Nvidia graphics card keep the power management in adaptive mode.
Nvidia's software is good at only using the GPU's max state if its ever needed by the application you're running.

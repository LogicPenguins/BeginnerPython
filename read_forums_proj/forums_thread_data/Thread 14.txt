I feel like I haven't been mowing my grass and I might as well park an old truck on cinder blocks in my yard.  So I spend too much time wandering around knocking back the grass blocks.

Wait, you mean the tall grass? I didn't think that spread on it's own. Haha

You can use shovel to make paths or just lay down cobble or other stone. You can cover ground with green carpet where you want it looking like grass. Other option is to shear leaves and lay down a layer of leaf blocks to look like a lawn. Or make flowerbeds.

I don't dislike it, nor do I really care much about them, but I may clear some or all of it, depending on what I deem necessary

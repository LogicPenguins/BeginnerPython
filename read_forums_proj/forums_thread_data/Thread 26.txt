You know your parents, so talk to them and find their reasons, and work with them, no one here knows their mindset as to why they won't give you the money for the game

 What worked for me is telling them it would help me keep my new friends when I changed schools.

Show your parents the game, they probably don't know what Minecraft is.

And as @Webbrosc said ask their mind set of why they don't want to buy the game.

Edit: If your parents don't want to buy it because of it's price ask if you could build up some sort of pocket money/allowance system.

I'm completely aware I'm several years late to this, but I haven't played Minecraft for a while, and so there's a lot of stuff that I missed. What happened with the textures? I honestly can't figure out which ones are better. On the one hand, the old ones are more iconic, but on the other, the new ones look more clean. I can't decide whether I like the character of the old textures, or the clarity of the new ones. What do you guys think?

What happened with the textures?

Back in 2018, Mojang hired a pixel artist called Jasper Boerstra (JAPPA). When something is added to the game, the programmers make initial textures for it (this was the original process) and these are included in the 'Programmer Art' pack, then JAPPA comes in and refines the textures for use in the default Minecraft pack.


What do you guys think?

I personally prefer the Programmer Art, something about the newer textures just looks weird to me. Obviously which one you prefer is down to you though.

I generally play with the old ones too, since they have a lot more character. I appreciate Jappa's effort though, and might try making a texture pack that mixes them together. Shouldn't be too hard, just replace the ones I want. Also might tone down the spots on oak wood, they are a bit weird.

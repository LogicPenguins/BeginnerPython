Hi everyone, I'm Mike and I have a question:

I created my first MC world and I've been working on it for days, only to realize I created it on my daughter's account. Is it possible to create my own account and transfer that saved world from her account to mine so that I can continue working on it on my own account?

Thanks in advance -

On Minecraft Java you can find your saves at:

C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\

If you change your account, the save location keeps the same

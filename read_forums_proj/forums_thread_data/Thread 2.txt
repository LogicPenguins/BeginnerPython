In most cases, it is one or more chunks broken - the latst.log often shows which block/item/entity or chunk is affected
With NBT editor tools, you can remove blocks and chunks

Updating a world to a newer version should not break your world - for older versions, the launcher asks for creating a backup of your world
To find out more, you have to take a look at the crash-report or latest.log

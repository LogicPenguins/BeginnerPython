# Small Projects Python
This is a collection of all the projects I have completed so far in my Python journey. This repository will be updated whenever a new project is added. Below will be a brief description of each folder. 

## Collatz Conjecture Project

The [Collatz Conjecture Project](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/Collatz%20Conjecture) is a program I made to play around with the collatz conjecture. For those who are not aware, the collatz conjecture is somewhat of a mathematical paradox. Further details about the collatz conjecture can be found through this hyper link: [Collatz Conjecture](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/)

## Downloads

The [downloads](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/downloads) project is not really a project, but more of a dump for abstract or random download files, whether those be plain text or binary files. It's more so of a testing ground for storing temporary download files.

## ExercisesATBSWP

The [exercisesATBSWP](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/exercisesATBSWP) is a folder that contains a number of mini-projects. These projects don't have their own seperate project folders in the main repository because they've been considered too small to need any individual space. For those wondering, ATBSWP is a reference to the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, a book for beginners to learn Python. For those interested in checking it out, here is a hyperlink to the book: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

## Logs

Similar to the [downloads](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/downloads) folder, the [logs](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/logs) folder contains a dump of random logs for temporary files or for testing.

## Open Browser

The [openbrowser](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/openbrowser) is a folder containing a few projects that were based majorly around the openbbrowser module in Python. These projects each have their own purpose, but were all fairly small and simple so were not given their own individual folders.

## Python Playground

The [pythonplayground](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/pythonplayground) folder contains a special Python file. This file is used for testing out Python features for fun or for direct uses in a larger project. This file changes on a daily basis, so nothing in it will ever be consistent code. Regardless, it's a very cool file.

## Read Forums Project

The [read_forums_proj](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/read_forums_proj) folder contains the contents of one of my longest and most-effort self-made projects. This project uses the BeautifulSoup module and Requests module to parse through the HTML on the Minecraft Discussions Forums and extract information to then download into numerous text files, which are also provided as examples in their own data sub-folder called [forums_thread_data](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/read_forums_proj/forums_thread_data).
All in all, this was a pretty fun project to create and I'm quite of myself for having been able to make it.

## RPG Project

The [rpg](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/rpg) folder contains the roots of a game I began creating in my early days of Python learning. It was more or less a text based RPG game through terminal. I discontinued the project soon after beginning it because it felt a little repetitive and not worth the time, in which I could be doing more productive things such as learning new Python concepts. However, I decided to keep the project as it's own folder in memory of one of my first self-made projects on Python.

## Small Projects

Similar to [exercisesATBSWP](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/exercisesATBSWP), [smallprojects](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/smallprojects) contains a list of mini-projects that each have unique abilities and conveniences for daily life, but just weren't big enough for their own folders in the main repository. 

## Zip Project

The [zipproj](https://github.com/Xmexy/beginnerprojects/tree/main/zipproj) is a folder that contains a collection of 4 different variations of a main goal, which was to turn contents of a parent folder and all of it's sub-folders and files into a compressed ZIP file. Each project inside the zipproj folder serves it's own purpose. 

## Excel Projects

The [Excel_Projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/Excel_Mini_Projs) is a collection of projects based around the openpyxl module, using OpenOffice as my harbor for Excel SpreadSheets. 

## CSV Projects

The [CSV_Projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/CSV_Projs) is a collection of projects that utilize .csv files and are based around programs that use these files for converting, transferring and interpreting data, whether it be turning the data into an excel spreadsheet, vice versa, or using it to remove headers and testing out features of the csv module in Python.

## JSON Projects

The [JSON_Projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/JSON_Projs) consists of essentially projects based around the same idea as the [CSV_Projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/CSV_Projs) folder. Containing mini-projects that have to do with .json files. 

## IMAP Projects
[imap_projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/imap_projs) is a folder that includes projects which utilize the imapclient module in Python, as well as some utilizing the imaplib. The IMAP module, for those who are unaware, is a module that is used to process emails such as reading and deleting, through certain emailing sites (yahoo, google, etc).

## SMTP Projects
Considerably similar to the [imap_projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/imap_projs) folder, the [smtp_projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/smtp_projs) folder contains programs utilizing the SMTP module in Python. The SMTP module, for those who are unaware, is a module that is used to send emails through certain emailing sites (yahoo, google, etc).

## Text Projects
The [text_projs](https://github.com/Xmexy/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/text_projs) is a folder containing projects that utilize the twilio client to send text messages to mobile devices. Twilio is a service for programmatically sending and receiving text msgs through features such as SMS. A very cool Python module and very convenient for setting personal reminders for yourself.
